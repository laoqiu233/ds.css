# Dmitri's styles
## What is this?
ds.css is a library *(Potentially framework?question mark???)* with all the common classes that I use
in web development.
## Why? Isn't there a lot of better frameworks?
Because I want to improve my front-end knowledge, and I like making my own stuff.
bich dont judge me
